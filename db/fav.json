    "longDescription": "High powered businessman Howard Langston (Arnold Schwarzenegger), is hard at work taking last-minute orders from customers to whom he just can't say no, including his son, Jamie (Jake Lloyd), who asked for the hottest action figure of the season -- Turbo Man!  Unfortunately, Howard is facing one BIG problem.  It's Christmas Eve and Turbo Man has been sold out since Thanksgiving!  Howard's down-to-the-wire trek to find Turbo Man quickly turns into an odyssey wilder than he could have ever imagined.  In the course of his seemingly endless Yuletide misadventures, he finds himself in a no-holds-barred fight-to-the-finish with a crazed postman named Myron (Sinbad), who is out to claim the last Turbo Man for his kid.  It's enough to scare away even the bravest of men. But to Howard, this is war -- and he's determined to win...no matter what!",
